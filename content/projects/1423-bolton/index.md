This project involved a full renovation of the basement and kitchen. Through the process of underpinning the foundation, we were able to drop the basement floor almost two feet, which allowed for the addition of an entire floor to the livable space in the home. In the kitchen, the rear wall was rebuilt to accommodate a large window and door. Adding a new basement stair and refinishing the floors throughout the first floor completed this extensive renovation project.
