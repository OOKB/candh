This Bolton Hill home had previously received a full Mid-Century Modern renovation in the 1970â€™s, creating an open central staircase and a split-level first floor. Our project involved entirely remodeling and updating the kitchen to meet contemporary standards while simultaneously keeping in line with the Mid-Century aesthetic. Coupled with a full-sandout of the dark oak floors and stairs, and repainting of the interior, the end result was a completely fresh look to a truly distinctive home.
